== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Advanced Import is a free plugin? =

Yes, it is a free plugin.

= Why my demo zip file is not importing? =

Please make sure it is exported using the [Advanced Export](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-export/) plugin

= I have activated the plugin. Where is the "Demo Import"? =

Login to your WordPress dashboard, go to Appearance -> Demo Import.
You can also find Import zip options on WordPress dashboard -> Tools -> Advanced Import.

= Do I need to check to include media while Export? =

If you are providing starter content- NO, but if you are migrating site - Yes. As long as the exported site is live on the internet it is not necessary but if you are migrating the site from local to live you should check it.
Technically, if you check to include media, the zip files content media files. Huge media files may cause other issues. Generally not recommended to check but you can check media as your requirements.

= I am a theme author, how can I use this plugin for my theme? =

First of all, you need to Export your theme demo data from your live demo site using [Advanced Export](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-export/) plugin.
Export the zip file, it should contain 3 files content.json, options.json and widgets.json.
If you are submitting theme on WordPress dot org, you are not allowed to include Demo files ( XML, JSON, ZIP), You have to create a separate plugin for your theme/company. We would like to highly recommend to create a single plugin for your all themes. For other platforms, you may add code on your theme.
